Git encourages branch use.

	***git branch***
	check branches

	***git branch <name>***
	create a new branch
	sometimes we create a new branch to fix bugs and merge it afterwards

	***git checkout <name>***
	switch to another branch

	***git checkout -b <name>***
	create & switch

	***git merge <branchname>***
	merge a branch to current branch
	sometimes need to manually solve conflict

	***git branch -d <branchname>***
	delete a branch
