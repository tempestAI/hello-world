	***git remote***
	check name of remote repository
	default=origin


	***git push <remote repository> <local branch>***
	push local branch to remote repository
	. usually we push branch 'master' or 'dev'
	. if your boss would like to know how many bugs you have fixed,
	  it is ok to push a branch with bugs
	
	if push failed, which means conflict, you should use
	
	***git branch --set-upstream <local branch> <remote branch>***
	to get your branch and remote branch associated, then use

	***git pull***
	and fix conflict according to hints

	
	***git clone ...***
	make sure you add your SSH key to owner's github
	'clone' can only fetch 'master' branch

	***git checkout -b <local newbranch> <remote repository/branchname>
	fetch a remote branch
	it is strongly recommended that you name the new one same with
	the remote one.
